why Arrays?
we create variables to store the information but we want to store the large 
information we have to create so many variables with different names it is so 
complex to remember such a huge number of variable names so we approach collection 
concept such as arrays...
what is array?
arrays is index based data structure to store large volume of data using single name(variable name)
that stores homogeneous data.arrays are treated as object in java.memory is allocated in heap area.
we use new keyword to create object in java.
int[] a=new int[5];
collection of similar data under single variable name.
2-d array(regular):
int[][] ar=new int[3][4];
3-d array(regular):
int[][][] ar=new int[3][4][3];
jagged array:
int[][] ar=new int[3][];
a[0]=new int[5];
a[0]=new int[4];
a[0]=new int[3];
3-d array(jagged):
3 coleges different number of classes and different number of students.
int[][][] ar=new int[3][][];
ar[0]=new int[2][];
ar[1]=new int[4][];
ar[2]=new int[3][];
ar[0][0]=new it[4];
ar[0][1]=new int[2];
.
