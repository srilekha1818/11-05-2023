why Arrays?
we create variables to store the information but we want to store the large 
information we have to create so many variables with different names it is so 
complex to remember such a huge number of variable names so we approach collection 
concept such as arrays...
what is array?
arrays is index based data structure to store large volume of data using single name(variable name)
that stores homogeneous data.arrays are treated as object in java.memory is allocated in heap area.
we use new keyword to create object in java.
int[] a=new int[5];
collection of similar data under single variable name.
2-d array(regular):
int[][] ar=new int[3][4];
3-d array(regular):
int[][][] ar=new int[3][4][3];
jagged array:
int[][] ar=new int[3][];
a[0]=new int[5];
a[0]=new int[4];
a[0]=new int[3];
3-d array(jagged):
3 coleges different number of classes and different number of students.
int[][][] ar=new int[3][][];
ar[0]=new int[2][];
ar[1]=new int[4][];
ar[2]=new int[3][];
ar[0][0]=new it[4];
ar[0][1]=new int[2];
.
.
continues.
Arrays in java are guarded with the boundaries.so there is no buffer overrun problem in java.
collections concept can be applied to not only to primitive data types but 
also used for objects type but it should be of type homogeneous.
size of array is fixed and it cannot shrink or grow.
contiguous memory is one of the disadvantage,
To overcome this disadvantage we use arraylist concept of collections.
for-each loop(advanced for loop) is very useful there s no need to mention 
the starting and ending index of the array also very useful for iteration.
limitation of for-each loop is :
we don't have any control of index so we cannot modification to the array.
for-each loop traverse or iterate only in forward direction.
int [] [] a,b; =>a,b are two dimensional arrays
int [][]a[],b;=>a is 3d array and b is 2d array.
int []a ,b[];=>a is 1d,b is 2d array.
Every type of array has a class internally that's used for 
internal purposes and not used by the programmer.
int [] a=new int[4];=>class is [I
all the methods in the Arrays class are static in nature.static methods doesn't required 
to create the object to call the methods.we can call them with their classnames to call methods.
int [] a={10,50,60,30,20};
Arrays.sort(a);
int[] ar=new int[5];
Arrays.fill(a,5);
note:sort,fill are the static methods of the utility class named Arrays.
element:data that we store in the array object.
