whenever we want to perform a task we create a method in java.if method requires parameters to be passed then we should pass the arguments for sure.
method overloading: multiple methods with same name but differ in maybe the type of parameters,number of parameters in the same class can be known as method overloading.
compiler consider the number of parameters,datatype of parameters,order of datatype of parameters to find the suitable method with same name as per requirement that's why it's also known as compile time polymorphism.
 it will reduce the complexity of remembering different method names.
method overloading also known as early binding.
return type has no role to play,only method name and parameters are matters in method overloading.
method overloading with numeric type promotion.it checks the capacity of the methods.
can we overload main method in java?
yes,we can overload main method however jvm will call such a main method that accepts String[] args as parameters.
