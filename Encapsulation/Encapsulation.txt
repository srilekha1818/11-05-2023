oops pillars:
1.encapsulation:privacy & security.(data hiding & binding)
2.polymorphism:code flexibility
3.inheritance:code reusability
4.abstraction:implementation details hiding.

encapsulation:provides data security.class that is having only private modifier variable can be known as bean.
getters and setters are been used in encapsulation and this keyword plays a keyrole 
to avoid shadowing problem due to the differences between the names of the variables.
we can create one setter for all the objects but it is not same with the getters.
this keyword reference the currently running object.
