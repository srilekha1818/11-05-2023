inner classes are the classes that present inside the other class.
we use inner class for the entity maintenance in the project or if a class is purposefully needed for the other class.
this concept is hardly used very less times in the project.
anonymous inner class is used mostly in the implementation of abstract classes,interface,ovverriding method concepts.
if the inner class is static we can access it using outer class name.we can make only inner classes as static.
if the inner class is non static we use object of outerclass to access inner class members.
anonymous inner class is placed between semicolon and the constructor
we don't make outer class static as it is no need to make it static .
anonymous inner class counts when we count the classes in a program($1).
