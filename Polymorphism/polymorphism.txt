Loose coupling:whenever we are creating the objects,the reference type is parent type then it is known as loose coupling.
Tight coupling:the reference type of object and object type are same they are known as tight coupling.

while loose coupling,we are understanding that we are doing one to many .
creating parent type reference is useful to achieve polymorphism.true polymorphism is useful for code flexibilty.

directly,using parent type reference we cannot call child specialized methods.but by changing
 the behaviour of parent we can call the specialized methods in child class(downcasting) .

 for child objects creating parent type reference is known as upcasting and viceversa to downcasting.
((childref)parent).specializedmethodname;

Abstraction:hiding actual implementation details and showing only the features can be known as abstraction.
abstract keyword is used to methods.abstract methods are such methods where they don't have any implementation/body but it only have method signature.

In a class if there is any abstraction method it is mandatory to keep the class abstract.Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods.
abstract keyword cannot be applied to variables.
