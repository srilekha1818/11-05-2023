String is an object in the package java.lang.String
it is a collection of characters.
String is immutable in nature ,if you try to modify you cannot do it.
StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable in nature.
String s1=new String("sachin");//two copies availabe for this object.one in heap area and 
the other in scp(string constant pool) without reference.
String s2="sachin";//created string using direct literal then 
only one copy of the object gets created(memory available) in scp with reference.
s1==s2 is false.s1.equals (s2) is true as it compares only the content but not the references/objects.

StringBuilder s1=new StringBuilder("Bandra");
StringBuilder s2=new StringBuilder("Bandra");//s1==s2 and s1.equals(s2) is false as two references get cretaed and comparision is not about the content.
e.g:you can perform concatenation on s1 and s2.
scp:no duplicates are allowed.same object can be used by diiferent users or variables.
scp is immutable in nature.
String s1=new String("sachin");//s1 is stored as an array in heap memory but we cannot apply the indexing method on strings you get compile time error.
we can use charAt() method to get particualr index value in string.
equals method compares the content.
