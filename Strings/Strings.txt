String is an object in the package java.lang.String
it is a collection of characters.
String is immutable in nature ,if you try to modify you cannot do it.
StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable in nature.
String s1=new String("sachin");//two copies availabe for this object.one in heap area and 
the other in scp(string constant pool) without reference.
String s2="sachin";//created string using direct literal then 
only one copy of the object gets created(memory available) in scp with reference.
s1==s2 is false.s1.equals (s2) is true as it compares only the content but not the references/objects.

StringBuilder s1=new StringBuilder("Bandra");
StringBuilder s2=new StringBuilder("Bandra");//s1==s2 and s1.equals(s2) is false as two references get cretaed and comparision is not about the content.
e.g:you can perform concatenation on s1 and s2.
scp:no duplicates are allowed.same object can be used by diiferent users or variables.
scp is immutable in nature.
String s1=new String("sachin");//s1 is stored as an array in heap memory but we cannot apply the indexing method on strings you get compile time error.
we can use charAt() method to get particualr index value in string.
equals method compares the content includes case sensitivity.
equalsignorecase ignore the type of case.
s.length => gives compile time error cause strings don't hve length propery.
s.substr(int begin,int end); => gives begin to end-1 string characters.
s.substr(9);gives 9 to end characters.
s.replace('a','b');
s.indexOf('h');
s.lastIndexOf('n');
concat() and toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(),toString() are some of the important methods in the string class.
StringBuilder,StringBuffer and all wrapper classes(byte,int,short,long,float,double,character,boolean) are by default mutable.
mutable-can be changed.
immutable-can't be changed.
if we use final to StringBuffer object we cannot refer the object to another object and it can modified.
whenever content is modified frequently,we use StringBuffer/StringBuilder.
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer(15);
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("sachin");
sb is an empty string buffer with default capacity 16.
new capacity =(old capacity+1)*2
length(),capacity() are the methods of StringBuffer.
15 => length 
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("sachin");
("sachin") =>capacity is 22.length is 6.
sb.setCharAt(5,'o');//sachon
sb.insert(5,'i');//sachoin
sb.insert(5,11);//sacho11in
sb.insert(5,"hii");//sachohii11in;
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer(1000);//1000
sb.append("sachin");//1000
sb.trimToSize();
 System.out.println(sb);//6
 methods of StringBuffer are synchronized(1.0v multi threading) and methods of StringBuilder(1.5v) are not synchronized.
StringBuffer:threadafe is required.
StringBuilder:threadsafety is required.
methodchaining:we can apply methodchaining if return type of the methods are same.
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
sb.append("sachin").insert(6,"tendulkar").reverse().append("ind").delete(0,4).reverse();
 System.out.println(sb);
